Food insecurity is a significant threat to developing nations and their people. The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) is the US organization responsible for tracking and predicting food crises world wide and enables the US government to posture resources to prevent and or alleviate famines. Thus, FEWSNET collects a plethora of data, which ranges from satellite imagery analysis (NDVI) to population demographics at the district level. In this project, I used a compiled dataset from the World Bank to try and predict food crises using simple logistic regression and neural network.

This effort was part of a final project for a graduate class in introductory machine learning. Following the completion of the attached project, I followed up with my professors to improve the neural network algorithms, and ultimately we published our findings to MDPI's Journal AI. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to that code base but wanted to share my initial stab at the problem set.  However, you can find the write-up here:
